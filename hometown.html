Let me first introduce you all to my birth country before taking you through a virtual ride of my hometown.<br><br>

<b>India</b>, officially the <b>Republic of India</b> is a country in South Asia. It is second largest country in population and seventh largest country by land area. It is also the most populous democracy in the world bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. India�s frontier, which is roughly one-third coastline, abouts six countries. It is bounded to the northwest by Pakistan, to the north by Nepal, China, and Bhutan; and to the east by Myanmar (Burma). Bangladesh to the east is surrounded by India to the north, east, and west. The island country of Sri Lanka is situated some 40 miles (65 km) off the southeast coast of India across the Palk Strait and Gulf of Mannar.<br><br>

India has three of the most populous and cosmopolitan cities in the world�Mumbai (Bombay), Kolkata (Calcutta), and Delhi. Three other Indian cities�Bengaluru (Bangalore), Chennai (Madras), and Hyderabad�are among the world�s fastest-growing high-technology centres, and most of the world�s major information technology and software companies now have offices in India.

Now lets talk about my Hometown which is <b>Mumbai (Bombay)</b>
<p>
Mumbai, previously known as Bombay is one of the most populous and biggest cities of Maharashtra. Also the biggest metropolis of this state, Mumbai is also popular as the entertainment and financial capital. It is the largest city of India and fondly called as the city of dreams. It is a place filled with dreamers and people who work hard day and night to achieve their dreams. From struggling actors, laboureres, Bollywood stars to gangsters, Mumbai has a lot. A lot that can be written about and talked about! Mumbai is also home to one of the biggest slum area as well as home to the richest and thus it is only fair to describe Mumbai as a city for all. The majorsly spoken language is definitely Hindi , but this city has welcomed people from all faiths and religion warmly. If you want to know and experience diversity, visit Mumbai. This city also has its very own language that is the Bambaiiya Hindi. Known to be a city filled with warm and friendly people, we believe that anything written about Mumbai is never enough.
